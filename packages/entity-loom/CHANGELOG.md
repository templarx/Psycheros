# Changelog

All notable changes to entity-loom are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this package follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Code formatting refreshed (deno fmt).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Version chip in the wizard and graph viewer (lower-right corner). Clicks
  through to the GitHub release page for the running version; staging builds
  render the chip non-interactive with `· staging` flavor. Tooltip surfaces both
  entity-loom and entity-core versions since the graph engine version is often
  the operationally important one.
- `/api/version` endpoint on the main wizard server returns the version payload
  as JSON so the launcher dashboard can render an entity-loom service card the
  same way it consumes psycheros's `/health`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Package documentation refreshed for consumer-facing source releases (rolled in
  from the broader docs sweep ahead of the first GitHub Pages deploy).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Initial public release. Version `0.2.0` (not `0.1.0`) reflects the internal
  lineage prior to first public release.
- Web wizard that converts AI-companion chat histories from foreign platforms
  into a structured import package ingestible by Psycheros / entity-core. Useful
  on its own for any persistent-AI-companion ecosystem that wants to seed an
  entity from existing conversations.
- Supported source platforms:
  - **ChatGPT** — native data export + the GerTex ChatGPT Exporter Chrome
    extension
  - **Claude** — data-export JSONL / JSON
  - **SillyTavern** — JSONL chats
  - **Letta** — agent chat-log JSON
  - **Kindroid / KinLog** — JSON
- Five-stage wizard served at `http://localhost:3210`.
