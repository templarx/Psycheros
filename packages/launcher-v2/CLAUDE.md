# launcher-v2 — agent card

Tauri 2.x desktop app that installs Psycheros as an **OS-supervised service**
(launchd / systemd-user / Task Scheduler), renders the chat UI inline by
navigating the webview to the daemon's `localhost:3000`, and provides an in-app
manager surface for install/uninstall, status, logs, and updates. Replaces the
v1 `packages/launcher` HTTP-server-in-a-browser-tab shape.

First-person convention applies — see [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). The
launcher itself is utility surface, not entity surface, so this convention
mainly affects user-facing copy in `frontend/` (titles, error messages), not
Rust internals.

## Commands

```bash
# Dev (from inside packages/launcher-v2/):
./scripts/setup.sh                        # one-time: stage Deno + icons
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@^2.0 dev        # or cargo install tauri-cli && cargo tauri dev

# Build a distributable (.app / .msi / .deb / .AppImage):
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@^2.0 build

# Rust gates:
cd src-tauri && cargo check
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

Psycheros source is NOT embedded in the launcher binary — it gets cloned at
first-run from the public repo at the latest `psycheros-v*` tag. See
[`docs/source-provisioning.md`](docs/source-provisioning.md).

This package is **not in the Deno workspace** — it's Rust + plain HTML/JS/CSS.
The root `deno.json` workspace list intentionally omits it.

## Architectural pillars (do not violate)

1. **The launcher does not own the daemon process.** It installs an OS service
   definition; the OS supervises. Closing/crashing the launcher never touches
   the daemon. See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
2. **Cross-platform via trait, not `#[cfg]` everywhere.** All daemon lifecycle
   goes through [`supervisor::ServiceSupervisor`]. macOS (launchd) and Windows
   (Task Scheduler) are full impls; Linux (systemd-user) is a stub with explicit
   `NotImplemented`. See [`docs/supervisors.md`](docs/supervisors.md).
3. **One window, two surfaces.** Chat and manager render in the same `main`
   window. `Cmd+,` toggles. The webview navigates between `tauri://localhost/`
   (manager) and `http://localhost:3000/` (chat).
4. **Navigation is driven from Rust, not JS.** Cross-origin restrictions prevent
   JS in either context from reliably navigating to the other. `webview.eval()`
   from Rust sidesteps this. See
   [`daemon::navigation`](src-tauri/src/daemon/navigation.rs).
5. **Frontend never directly polls the daemon HTTP.** It calls Rust commands;
   Rust does the TCP probe + supervisor query. This avoids webview CORS issues
   entirely.

                          backup/restore endpoints (no reqwest/tokio overhead)

commands.rs               #[tauri::command] surface — JS RPC entry points
```

The frontend (`frontend/`) is plain HTML/CSS/JS — no bundler. Tauri's
`withGlobalTauri: true` exposes the IPC API on `window.__TAURI__` so JS can
`invoke()` Rust commands and `listen()` for events without a build step. The
split is intentional: keep the build surface small until product needs demand
otherwise.

## State machine: daemon state

`daemon::probe()` combines three signals — plist file exists (`is_installed`),
service loaded in launchctl (`is_loaded`), and TCP port bound — into a single
`DaemonState`:

| installed | loaded | port | state          | manager card shows                       |
| --------- | ------ | ---- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| no        | no     | no   | `NotInstalled` | Install autostart \| Install manual      |
| yes       | no     | no   | `Stopped`      | Start daemon \| Uninstall                |
| yes       | yes    | no   | `Installed`    | (transient — booting or crashlooping)    |
| _         | _      | yes  | `Running`      | Back to chat \| Stop daemon \| Uninstall |

`Stopped` is distinct from `NotInstalled`: the user clicked Stop, but the
service definition is still on disk. At next login (autostart) or next manual
Start (either mode) the daemon comes back. Port-bound implies `Running`
regardless of supervisor state, so users who run `deno task start` from a
terminal still get a working chat UI.

Daemon mode (`DaemonMode::Autostart | Manual`) lives in `config.daemon_mode` and
affects the plist content (`RunAtLoad`/`KeepAlive`) at install time, plus
mode-aware copy in the manager card. `Stop` is universal — for autostart it's a
session-scoped unload (daemon back at next login); for manual it stays stopped.

## State machine: view mode

`AppState.user_summoned` is the only flag distinguishing "splash because daemon
is down" from "splash because user pressed Cmd+,":

| state        | user_summoned | what the user sees           | on daemon → Running  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Running      | false         | chat UI                      | (already there)      |
| Running      | true          | manager (user wants it)      | **stays on manager** |
| Installed    | false         | manager, "daemon starting…"  | auto-flips to chat   |
| Installed    | true          | same                         | **stays on manager** |
| NotInstalled | false         | manager, "install autostart" | auto-flips to chat   |
| NotInstalled | true          | same                         | **stays on manager** |

When daemon goes Running → not-Running, the launcher always auto-flips to the
manager (regardless of `user_summoned`) so the user has a recovery affordance
instead of a frozen chat window.

## Traps that bite

- **`window.__TAURI__` is undefined unless `withGlobalTauri: true`.** Tauri 2's
  default is `false`. Frontend will silently fail every IPC call if this isn't
  set in `tauri.conf.json`. Already set; don't remove it.
- **`window.url()` returns different URLs in dev vs production.** Dev uses a
  random local port (`http://127.0.0.1:<random>/`); production uses
  `tauri://localhost/`. We capture it once at startup into `AppState.splash_url`
  to navigate back to from any origin.
- **`location.replace(sameURL)` triggers a hard reload.** Wipes splash JS state
  and looks like a glitch. `daemon::navigation::drive` de-dupes via
  `AppState.last_navigated`.
- **Tauri's icon validator requires RGBA, not RGB.** `cargo tauri dev` panics
  with "icon is not RGBA" if you pass color type 2 (RGB). Color type 6 (RGBA)
  only. `scripts/setup.sh` generates the right format.
- **`launchctl list <label>` exits 0 = loaded, 113 = not loaded.** Parse the
  exit code, not the stdout text — the latter varies across macOS versions and
  is meant for humans.
- **`KeepAlive=true` makes "Stop" useless.** `launchctl stop` is a no-op against
  KeepAlive — the daemon comes right back. The only real off switch is
  `launchctl unload` (session-scoped, used by Stop) or `launchctl unload -w`
  (persistent, used by Uninstall).
- **`window.confirm` / `window.alert` are silently blocked in Tauri 2 webviews**
  — they return `undefined`. Don't use them. The launcher has a themed in-app
  modal (`#confirm-modal`) wired via `confirmDialog()` in
  `frontend/js/manager.js`.
- **`git reset --hard origin/<branch>` breaks for tags.** Tags don't always get
  a remote-tracking ref. Use `FETCH_HEAD` instead — works for both branches and
  tags, and peels annotated tags to their commit automatically. See
  `bundle::clone_or_fetch_source`.
- **`--progress` flag is rejected by `git reset`** (exit 129). Only pass it to
  commands that accept it (`clone`, `fetch`); don't blanket-append.
- **Annotated tag SHA ≠ commit SHA.** `query_latest_tag` returns the tag name
  (e.g. `psycheros-v0.3.3`) which is the stable identifier; the actual SHA is
  exposed only for diagnostics.
- **`schtasks /Create /XML` requires UTF-16 LE with BOM.** UTF-8 input is
  rejected with a generic "malformed XML" error that's easy to lose an hour to.
  See [`task_scheduler::write_utf16_le_with_bom`].
- **`<UseUnifiedSchedulingEngine>true</...>` is incompatible with
  `<RestartOnFailure>`.** The unified engine rejects the legacy Interval/Count
  restart spec at /Create time. Task XML intentionally omits
  UseUnifiedSchedulingEngine so RestartOnFailure validates in autostart mode.
  The cost is slightly more Event Log noise; the benefit is crash-restart
  actually working.
- **`<RestartOnFailure><Interval>` has a one-minute minimum.** Per the Task
  Scheduler schema, anything smaller than `PT1M` is rejected at /Create time
  with `(N,M):Interval:<value> incorrectly formatted or
  out of range`. The
  error points at the value, not the constraint, which makes it easy to
  mis-diagnose as an XML-encoding bug. macOS's launchd has no equivalent
  minimum; we pay one minute of latency on the first restart after a crash on
  Windows.
- **Punctuation keys in menu accelerators need their named form.**
  `"CmdOrCtrl+,"` parses on macOS but silently fails on Windows
  (`keyboard-types` requires `"Comma"` for the `,` key, `"Period"` for `.`,
  etc.). The menu item builds fine and the menu renders fine; only the
  accelerator chord doesn't fire. Symptom: user reports "the shortcut doesn't
  work, I have to click the menu."
- **Menu accelerators don't fire from a webview-focused window on Windows.**
  Even after fixing the key-name issue above, WebView2 captures keyboard events
  before they reach the host's menu chain. The preferences chord is bound via
  `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` instead — an OS-level hotkey, gated on
  `window.is_focused()` so it matches the menu-accelerator semantic of "fires
  only when the app is foregrounded." See `register_preferences_shortcut_plugin`
  in `lib.rs`.
- **`set_mode_only` must preserve the `<Enabled>` flag.** A naive
  `/Create /XML /F` with hardcoded `<Enabled>true</Enabled>` would silently
  re-enable a daemon the user had Stopped — toggling the autostart-at-login
  preference would un-stop the daemon. The current impl reads `is_loaded()` and
  threads the result through `render_task_xml`.
- **`Status:` ≠ enabled state on Windows.** `schtasks /Query /FO LIST /V` emits
  both `Status:` (Ready / Running / Disabled / Queued — operational state) and
  `Scheduled Task State:` (Enabled / Disabled — persistent preference). The
  supervisor's `is_loaded` parses the **latter**; using Status alone would
  falsely mark a Ready-but-Enabled task as not-loaded.
- **`schtasks /End` doesn't cascade to children.** Task Scheduler kills only the
  action's root process; children become orphans. The `psycheros-daemon-runner`
  sidecar solves this by enrolling itself + deno into a Job Object with
  `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so the kernel cascades the kill when the
  runner dies. Don't replace the runner with a plain shell wrapper without
  rebuilding this guarantee.
- **`cargo run` needs `default-run = "psycheros-launcher"`.** With two `[[bin]]`
  targets (launcher + daemon-runner) Cargo can't pick a default;
  `cargo tauri dev` shells out to `cargo run` and fails without the manifest
  key.
- **`deno cache` needs `--allow-scripts` for psycheros's native deps.**
  `onnxruntime-node` (embeddings) and `sharp` (image processing) publish
  lifecycle (postinstall) scripts that Deno 2.x blocks by default for security.
  Without the flag, first-run's warm-cache step can fail with
  `error: failed to run scripts for packages:
  onnxruntime-node` and a
  `node:module` stack trace. `bundle::warm_deno_cache` passes the broad form
  (`--allow-scripts`, not `--allow-scripts=npm:onnxruntime-node`) because we
  trust the pinned Psycheros source we just cloned and the daemon itself runs
  with `-A` anyway. Even with the flag, the scripts still fail on cold installs
  because Deno's `nodeModulesDir:"auto"` flat `.deno/` layout breaks Node's
  `require()` resolution from within lifecycle scripts (e.g. `sharp` can't find
  `semver/functions/coerce`). The packages are fully downloaded and the daemon
  works fine — `warm_deno_cache` detects this specific "failed to run scripts
  for packages" error and treats it as a non-fatal warning instead of aborting.
- **Every `Command::new` on Windows needs `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`.** Release builds
  have `windows_subsystem = "windows"` (no console), so any console-subsystem
  subprocess (`schtasks`, `whoami`, `netstat`, `tasklist`, `git`, `deno`,
  `where`, etc.) **allocates a new console window** because there's no parent
  console to inherit. The daemon- status watcher polls `schtasks /Query` every
  two seconds, producing a non-stop flicker of ghost cmd windows for the user.
  Route every spawn through `proc::hidden_command` — it applies
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows and is a pass-through elsewhere. **Don't** route
  `open_path` (the "Reveal in Explorer" affordance) through it — the user
  _wants_ that window. `open_url` (open in browser) does use `hidden_command` on
  Windows — `cmd /C start` is a console-subsystem tool and would flash
  otherwise. The bug is invisible in `cargo tauri dev` because debug builds
  default to `windows_subsystem = "console"` and subprocesses inherit the dev
  launcher's console; only release MSI installs surface it.
- **Don't add the daemon-runner as an `externalBin`.** It's a `[[bin]]` target
  in the same crate, so `cargo tauri build` auto-includes the compiled
  `target/release/psycheros-daemon-runner.exe` in the MSI alongside the main
  launcher exe. Listing it in `externalBin` too results in a WiX
  duplicate-component error (`psycheros_daemon_runner.exe` vs
  `psycheros_daemon_runner` — same final filename, same install dir, light.exe
  rejects the link). The runtime resolver finds the runner via
  `current_exe().parent().join(...)` — works in both dev (`target/debug`
  siblings) and prod (INSTALLDIR siblings).
- **macOS Tahoe enforces Team ID matching on `dlopen()`.** The official Deno
  binary is signed with Deno's Apple Developer Team ID; prebuilt native plugins
  from `@denosaurs/plug` (e.g. `@db/sqlite`) are signed with a different Team
  ID. On Tahoe, `dlopen()` rejects the load:
  `code signature
  not valid for use in process: mapping process and mapped file (non-platform)
  have different Team IDs`.
  The first-run flow handles this by ad-hoc re-signing both the staged Deno
  binary (`bundle::stage_bundled_binary`) and all cached `.dylib` files
  (`bundle::repair_plug_cache_signatures`) after `warm_deno_cache`.
  `codesign -f -s -` strips the original Team ID and replaces it with an ad-hoc
  signature (cdhash only, no Team ID) so both sides match. Safe on all macOS
  versions — pre-Tahoe systems never enforced this check.

## Cross-platform considerations

| Platform | Supervisor           | Sudo needed?              | Logs                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | launchd (user agent) | Never                     | Files at `<data>/logs/daemon.*.log`                           |
| Linux    | systemd user unit    | Once, for `enable-linger` | `journalctl --user -u psycheros`                              |
| Windows  | Task Scheduler       | Never (user-level task)   | Flat files at `<data>/logs/daemon.*.log` (via runner sidecar) |

The launchd impl is the reference. Other OSes follow the same trait contract but
the under-the-hood mechanics differ — see per-OS module doc comments and
[`docs/supervisors.md`](docs/supervisors.md) for the full picture.

## Companion packages

This package lives in the [Psycheros monorepo](../../README.md). It manages the
lifecycle of the sibling [`psycheros`](../psycheros/) daemon. Psycheros source
is NOT bundled into the launcher binary — it gets cloned at first run from the
public mirror at the latest `psycheros-v*` tag. It does not manage
[`entity-loom`](../entity-loom/) — Loom is a separate utility with its own
distribution story.

The v1 [`launcher`](../launcher/) is being replaced by this package. Delete v1
once v2 reaches feature parity per [`docs/migration.md`](docs/migration.md).
