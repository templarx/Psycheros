# Changelog

All notable changes to the Psycheros desktop launcher are documented here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this package
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). It is pre-1.0 until
cross-platform supervisors ship.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- `warm_deno_cache` error now includes the last 15 lines of `deno cache` stderr
  output so the actual diagnostic (missing native binary, network failure,
  lifecycle-script error, etc.) is visible instead of just the exit code.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- macOS: improved Deno sidecar resolution with multiple search strategies
  (Resource dir, executable parent, bundle walk-up) and diagnostic-rich error
  messages so failures are traceable.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- macOS: "bundled deno sidecar not found in app resources" error on first run.
  Tauri 2 places the Deno sidecar in `Contents/MacOS/`, not
  `Contents/Resources/` — the resolver now checks both locations.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Full Windows support**: MSI installer (WiX), standalone .exe (NSIS), Task
  Scheduler daemon supervisor, Win32 Job Object cascade-kill, system-tray
  integration, and Ctrl+, global shortcut — at parity with the macOS launchd
  reference. No UAC or admin required.
- **Windows runner sidecar** (`psycheros-daemon-runner.exe`): silent
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` Deno spawn wrapped in a Job Object so `schtasks /End`
  cascades cleanly to the daemon process.
- **Windows autologon task**: launcher boots silently to system tray at every
  user login, mirroring the macOS launcher-agent posture.
- **`CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on all subprocess spawns**: no ghost console windows from
  schtasks, whoami, netstat, tasklist, git, deno, or where.exe during normal
  operation.
- **Per-OS tray icons**: full-color 32x32 PNG on Windows, template PNG with
  auto-tint on macOS.
- **`tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`** for Ctrl+,/Cmd+, preferences chord, because
  Tauri 2 menu accelerators don't fire from WebView2-focused windows on Windows.
- **CI split**: `launcher-v2-macos` and `launcher-v2-windows` jobs in both
  check.yml and release.yml. Windows job builds .msi + .exe and uploads both to
  the GitHub release page.
- **Per-OS externalBin config** (`tauri.windows.conf.json`): avoids shipping
  Windows-only sidecars on macOS builds.
- **`setup.ps1`**: PowerShell equivalent of setup.sh for Windows dev setup.
- **13 new "Traps that bite" entries** in CLAUDE.md covering Windows-specific
  gotchas surfaced during the port.

### Changed

- `default-run = "psycheros-launcher"` in Cargo.toml (required by the new
  dual-`[[bin]]` layout).
- `splash_url` is now `Mutex<String>` with lazy capture to fix WebView2's
  about:blank race on preferences navigation.
- `stage_bundled_deno` renamed to `stage_bundled_binary` (back-compat alias).
- `--allow-scripts` added to Deno warm-cache so npm postinstalls (onnxruntime,
  sharp) complete during first-run.
- Update-watcher toast shows per-OS shortcut hint (⌘, on macOS, Ctrl+, on
  Windows/Linux).
- `check_port_conflict` uses `netstat -ano` + `tasklist` on Windows.
- `resolve_sidecar_binary` generic helper for future externalBin sidecars.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-20

### Fixed

- **macOS bundle now ad-hoc signed at the bundle level** (`tauri.conf.json`).
  Added `bundle.macOS.signingIdentity: "-"` so Tauri invokes `codesign --sign -`
  on the final `.app` after embedding the deno sidecar. Before this, the
  launcher binary carried only Rust's linker-signed stub and the bundle had no
  `Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources` at all. On Apple Silicon that
  combination is fatal: when a user downloads the `.dmg` from GitHub, Chrome
  sets `com.apple.quarantine`, AMFI sees no real CMS blob, and the kernel kills
  the process at launch before Gatekeeper can even prompt — bypassing the
  familiar "Open Anyway" workflow entirely. Proper ad-hoc signing keeps us in
  the no-cost / no-Apple-Developer-account posture but produces a signature AMFI
  accepts, so quarantined launches land on the standard Gatekeeper "cannot
  verify developer → Open Anyway" path documented in [`README.md`](README.md)
  and [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-20

### Added

- **Real brand icons across the launcher and `psycheros` web surface**
  (`packages/launcher-v2/src-tauri/icons/`, `packages/psycheros/web/icons/`).
  The launcher's placeholder solid-violet PNGs are replaced with the canonical
  heart-chip silhouette and the cyan→purple stroke gradient from
  `site/src/assets/psycheros-logo.svg`. `scripts/setup.sh` regenerates the full
  Tauri icon set (32x32, 128x128, 128x128@2x, .icns, .ico) from the canonical
  SVG via `sips` + `npx tauri icon`; the desktop variants are committed,
  mobile + Windows-tile noise is gitignored. A separate monochrome template
  variant (`tray-icon-template.svg`/.png) drives the menu-bar tray — macOS
  auto-tints to light/dark menu-bar themes via the alpha channel.
- **macOS menu-bar tray (always-on menu-bar agent)**
  (`src-tauri/src/app/tray.rs`, `src-tauri/src/supervisor/launcher_agent.rs`).
  The launcher is now a true menu-bar agent: a separate launchd plist
  (`ai.psycheros.launcher`) auto-starts the launcher at login with
  `--no-window`, the tray icon is the user's persistent surface, and the manager
  window is just a feature opened on demand. Hybrid activation policy —
  `Regular` when the window is visible (dock icon shows), `Accessory` when only
  the tray is up (dock icon hides) — matches the Tailscale / 1Password /
  Backblaze convention. Tray menu items: status label, Open chat, Open manager,
  Stop daemon, View logs, "Start Psycheros at login" checkbox. Left-click
  dispatches on daemon state (Running → chat, otherwise → manager). Cmd+Q routes
  through the same hide-then-surfaces-check path as the close button rather than
  process-killing, so the tray can't be stranded by a reflexive Cmd+Q.
- **Strict tray = daemon `Running` rule**. The tray icon is visible if and only
  if the daemon's `/health` probe answers Psycheros. Stop the daemon and the
  icon vanishes; the user's re-entry is the .app in /Applications. No-surfaces
  auto-exit retires the launcher process when both the tray and the window are
  hidden (with a has-been-running gate so login boot waits for the daemon to
  come up, and a 5-second exit grace so transients don't kill the launcher
  mid-flight).
- **HTTP `/health` probe disambiguation** (§probe). The daemon-state probe used
  to flip to `Running` whenever anything bound the port — a different project's
  Node dev server, a misconfigured test, etc. Now sends `GET /health` and
  matches `"name":"psycheros"` in the response body; only Psycheros's own health
  endpoint answers in that shape. Hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 (no new deps), bounded by
  a 500ms timeout. Six unit tests on the response-shape recognizer.
- **`LauncherConfig.port` actually wires through** (§probe + config). The probe
  and the daemon-config builder now read `cfg.port` instead of the const, so
  changing port in `config.json` no longer silently breaks backup/restore.
- **Autostart toggle is a preference change, not a daemon restart**. The
  Settings-card "Switch to Autostart/Manual" and the tray's "Start Psycheros at
  login" checkbox both flip a plist-content preference now —
  `LaunchdSupervisor::set_mode_only` writes the new RunAtLoad / KeepAlive
  content to the existing plist and returns. No `launchctl unload/load`, no
  daemon restart, no cascade of dropped HTTP connections through entity-core and
  the chat surface. macOS picks the new content up at next session load (next
  login), which is precisely when "autostart at login" matters. The `KeepAlive`
  crash-restart behavior takes effect at next daemon start.
- **End-to-end test harness via `tauri-plugin-webdriver`**
  (`packages/launcher-v2/e2e/`). Closes the largest empirical gap left after the
  smoke-binary + integration-test pass: the UI ↔ IPC boundary. Twelve specs
  across three files exercise the real Tauri webview — `smoke` (boots +
  renders), `wizard` (first-run form interactivity + defaults), `ipc` (read-only
  commands round-trip through `window.__TAURI__`, unknown commands reject). Each
  spec spawns a hermetic launcher in a temp `PSYCHEROS_LAUNCHER_DATA_DIR` and
  tears down on completion. Suite runs in ~2s locally. Opt-in cargo feature
  `webdriver` keeps the WebDriver server out of release builds. CI runs the
  suite on macos-14 as a fourth step in the `launcher-v2` job. See
  [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md).
- **CI release job for launcher-v2** (§5.23). New `launcher-v2` job in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`: macos-14 runner, sets up Rust
  - Deno, runs `./scripts/setup.sh` + `tauri build` for aarch64-apple-darwin,
    uploads the resulting `.dmg` + `.app.tar.gz` to the GitHub release page.
    Triggers on `launcher-v2-v*` tags; the v1 launcher job's matcher tightened
    to exclude v2 tags so a v2 tag doesn't fire both jobs. `--latest=false`
    keeps the repo-wide "Latest" badge on the v1 launcher during the transition
    window per `RELEASES.md`. A `release-footers/launcher-v2.md` covers the
    unsigned-Gatekeeper dance on the release page.
- **Operations runbook** (`docs/runbook.md`, §5.26). Symptom → recovery mapping
  for the common failure modes — crashloops, MCP offline, port conflicts,
  bootstrap failures, restore errors, etc. Links every symptom to the exact
  in-app button to click. Linked from the README's Troubleshooting section.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** for the launcher-v2 package (§5.25). Dev setup, build
  commands, gate commands, agent context. The README's former "Building from
  source (devs)" section is gone — README is now user-focused, CONTRIBUTING is
  dev-focused.
- **v1-roadmap.md marked complete** (§5.27). Banner at the top of the doc points
  future revisions at CHANGELOG entries. The file itself is preserved as the
  historical artifact of the planning + execution pass.
- **Migration runner during source updates** (§5.20). Between fetch and
  warm-cache, `apply_source_update` checks for a
  `migrations/<from-tag>-to-<to-tag>.ts` file in the cloned source root. When
  present, runs it via the bundled Deno with `-A` and the user's data dir as its
  sole argument, streaming stdout + stderr into the update progress ticker (new
  `migrate` phase). Missing file is a quiet no-op (most version bumps don't need
  migrations); non-zero exit aborts the update and leaves the source clone +
  data untouched — maintainers ship idempotent migrations so a retry safely
  resumes. Skipped on rollback (snapshots restore data directly).
- **Pin to specific version + rollback affordances** (§5.17 + §5.22).
  - `apply_source_update` now accepts an optional `target_tag`. With `None` (the
    default) it queries the latest channel tag and installs that. With
    `Some("psycheros-v0.3.2")` it installs that specific tag — used by the
    version picker and effective for forward-pin or rolling forward/back without
    restoring a snapshot.
  - `list_available_tags` Tauri command (`bundle::list_tags`) returns every tag
    on the configured channel, sorted highest semver first. Surfaced in the
    Settings card as a "Source version" dropdown + "Install version" button.
  - `rollback_to_snapshot(history_index)` Tauri command: stop daemon → wipe
    `<data>/.psycheros/` → restore from the entry's snapshot dir → reset source
    clone to the entry's tag → warm cache → start daemon. Emits the existing
    `source-update-progress` events with new `rollback-*` phase names so the
    bootstrap card's progress ticker renders the operation. Surfaced as a "Roll
    back" button on each rollback-eligible row in the diagnostics card's Update
    history section.
- **Pre-update snapshots + persisted update history** (§5.18 + §5.21). Before
  `apply_source_update` fetches the new tag, the launcher copies
  `<data>/.psycheros/` into a timestamped directory under
  `<launcher_data_dir>/.snapshots/`. On success it appends an
  `UpdateHistoryEntry` (tag / applied_at / previous_tag / snapshot_id) to
  `LauncherConfig.update_history` (capped at 10 entries; older snapshots pruned
  in lockstep). The diagnostics card now renders the history as a separate
  "Update history" section, with applied-at + previous-tag + a "rollback
  available" marker for entries whose snapshot still exists.
- **`get_update_history` Tauri command.** Returns the history list with
  `snapshot_id` cleared on any entry whose snapshot directory has been pruned —
  so callers can rely on `snapshot_id: Some(_)` meaning the rollback target
  still exists on disk. Sets up the §5.17 / §5.22 pin + rollback flows that come
  next.
- **Mode switch + update channel selection** in the Settings card.
  - `set_daemon_mode("autostart"|"manual")` overwrites the plist inline (no
    uninstall/reinstall round trip); the supervisor's `write_and_load_plist`
    already does unload → write → reload, so the flip is clean. Surfaced as a
    "Switch to Manual" / "Switch to Autostart" button next to the current-mode
    row.
  - `set_update_channel("stable"|"beta")` persists the chosen channel; the next
    `query_latest_tag` picks up the new prefix via `effective_tag_prefix()`.
    Stable tracks `psycheros-v*`, Beta tracks `psycheros-beta-v*`.
  - New `update_channel` field on `LauncherConfig`. Optional + serde default to
    `None` so old configs parse fine; `effective_channel()` treats `None` as
    Stable.
- **Self-repair warnings panel** in the manager card. Renders only when the
  launcher detects a problem the underlying state probes don't directly expose.
  Three warning sources for v1.0:
  - **MCP down** — log-line substring match for psycheros's MCP error patterns;
    surfaces a "Restart daemon" remediation.
  - **Crashloop** — daemon-status-changed history; if 3+ Running→Installed
    transitions occur within a 60-second window, surfaces a "Atlas keeps
    crashing" warning with a shortcut into the Data card's Re-init flow.
  - **Port conflict** — when stuck in Installed for >20 seconds, calls
    `check_port_conflict` (lsof on macOS) and renders the holding process's
    name + PID so the user knows what to quit.
- **`check_port_conflict` + `install_xcode_clt` Tauri commands.** Port-conflict
  uses `lsof -i :<port> -P -n -sTCP:LISTEN -Fpc` on macOS; install_xcode_clt
  spawns `xcode-select --install`. Linux + Windows return None / Err since their
  equivalents wait on the not-yet-implemented supervisors. 4 new unit tests on
  the lsof fielded-output parser.
- **Git-missing remediation in the bootstrap-error path** (§5.14). When
  `first_run` fails with the GitMissing fingerprint, the bootstrap card adds an
  "Install Xcode CLT" button alongside Try Again. Clicking it opens the system
  installer dialog; the explanatory error copy switches to "click Install in
  that dialog, then come back here."
- **Data management card** (`Data` button in the manager footer) with four
  actions, each behind an in-app confirm:
  - **Back up** — `backup_data` POSTs to psycheros's
    `/api/admin/entity-data/export`, streams the resulting zip to
    `~/Downloads/psycheros-backup-<UTC timestamp>.zip`. Simple confirm; daemon
    must be Running.
  - **Restore** — file picker (via `tauri-plugin-dialog`) → daemon's
    `/api/admin/entity-data/import` → automatic daemon restart on success.
    Simple confirm.
  - **Wipe entity data** — typed-confirm `WIPE`; clears the entity data dir
    (memories / identity / vault / settings / DB) while keeping the OS service
    registration. First-run re-templates fresh identity files on next daemon
    boot.
  - **Re-init** — typed-confirm `REINIT`; uninstalls the service, deletes the
    cloned source + identity dir, clears `bundled_source_version` so the next
    launch routes through the first-run wizard. Memories and vault content
    survive.
- **Minimal localhost HTTP/1.1 client** (`src/http.rs`). Hand-rolled ~200 lines
  so the data-management commands can call psycheros's admin API without pulling
  in `reqwest` + tokio + a TLS stack we don't need for `127.0.0.1` calls. 5 unit
  tests cover header parsing + the `\r\n\r\n` terminator.
- **`tauri-plugin-dialog`** for the OS-native file picker (Restore action).
  `dialog:allow-open` permission added to default capabilities.
- **Typed-confirm modal** alongside the existing simple-confirm modal. Requires
  the user to type a specific phrase before the destructive button activates;
  Esc dismisses; default-focus the input so it's keyboard-accessible.
- **Settings card** accessible from the manager footer (next to Diagnostics).
  View-only display of entity name / user name / timezone (from
  `read_general_settings`) and daemon port. The "Edit in Psycheros" button calls
  `set_view_mode("chat")` so the user navigates to psycheros's own settings UI
  for edits — keeping one source of truth for all entity-facing config. Button
  is disabled (with an explanatory title) when the daemon isn't Running, since
  the chat view is just a splash in that case.
- **Log panel filter + search + copy + save + load-more.** Level toggles (info /
  warn / error) drive a pure-CSS hide via `data-hide-*` attributes on the panel
  body. Search input does a case-insensitive substring filter, applied to both
  existing lines and new arrivals from the live tail. Copy uses
  `navigator.clipboard`; Save downloads a timestamped `.log` via a Blob URL.
  Load more re-reads `recent_daemon_log_lines` with a doubled tail size (cap 8
  MB), replacing the current panel content.
- **Shared `info-grid.js` module.** Renders labeled key/value grids with
  optional per-row action buttons. Diagnostics and Settings cards both consume
  it via `.info-grid` / `.info-row` / `.info-row__*` CSS classes.
  Diagnostics-specific class names (`.diagnostics__*`) renamed to the shared
  form in the same change.
- **Diagnostics card** accessible from the manager footer. Read-only snapshot of
  launcher version, installed source tag, daemon state + PID + last-exit-status
  (parsed from `launchctl list`), daemon mode, service label, filesystem paths
  (data dir / source dir / log dir / config / launcher data dir) with per-row
  "Reveal" buttons that open the path in Finder, recursive byte count of the
  entity data dir, upstream repo URL + tag prefix. On-demand fetch — no polling
  — with a Refresh button for re-reading after a daemon restart.
- **`get_diagnostics` / `open_path` Tauri commands.** Diagnostics builds a full
  snapshot on a blocking thread (the disk walk and `launchctl list` are
  I/O-bound); open_path shells to `open` / `xdg-open` / `explorer` per OS.
- **`ServiceSupervisor::query_runtime_info`** — best-effort
  `RuntimeInfo { pid, last_exit_status }` parsed from the supervisor's native
  status output. launchd impl walks `launchctl list <label>` lines; the default
  trait impl returns `RuntimeInfo::default()`, so Linux / Windows stubs need no
  per-platform code yet.
- **`DaemonState::as_str()`** — stable kebab-case string view matching the
  existing `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]`, used by diagnostics to surface
  state without going through serde.
- **`read_general_settings` Tauri command.** Direct disk read of psycheros's
  `<data>/.psycheros/general-settings.json`, returning `Option<GeneralSettings>`
  (None when the file is absent on a fresh install). Works when the daemon is
  down — used by the wizard's pre-fill, and slated for upcoming diagnostics +
  settings cards.
- **Wizard pre-fill from existing general-settings.json.** When the user re-runs
  the wizard (e.g. after a reinstall that preserved the data dir), the entity
  name / user name / timezone inputs come up pre-populated from psycheros's own
  settings rather than the generic defaults. Fresh installs still see the
  default "Assistant" / "You" / browser-detected timezone.
- **Source-as-git-clone provisioning.** Replaces the original tarball model.
  `bundle::clone_or_fetch_source` shallow-clones the public Psycheros repo at
  the latest matching `psycheros-v*` tag into `<data>/source/` on first run, and
  fetches forward on update. No source bundled inside the `.app`.
- **Tag-tracked update detection + apply.** `bundle::query_latest_tag` semver-
  sorts client-side; `check_for_updates` Tauri command returns
  `UpdateInfo { current_version, latest_version, update_available }`;
  `apply_source_update` runs fetch + reset to FETCH_HEAD + warm cache +
  `supervisor.restart()` with streamed `source-update-progress` events.
- **Background update watcher** (`src/app/update_watcher.rs`). Polls upstream
  every 3 hours, emits `update-available`, injects an in-window
  webview-eval-driven toast on rising-edge transitions. `window.confirm` is
  blocked in Tauri 2 webviews so we never use it — see "Confirm modal" below.
- **Manual daemon mode**, alongside the existing autostart mode.
  `DaemonMode { Autostart, Manual }` enum on `LauncherConfig`. Supervisor trait
  grew `install_autostart`, `install_manual`, `start_daemon`, `stop_daemon`,
  `is_installed`. launchd impl writes two plist variants (autostart =
  `RunAtLoad=true` + `KeepAlive=true`; manual omits `KeepAlive`). Stop is
  session-scoped `launchctl unload` (no `-w`) so autostart users can pause for
  the session without flipping their persistent enable state.
- **New `Stopped` daemon state** in `daemon::probe`. Plist file present but not
  loaded in launchctl = user manually stopped (vs. NotInstalled = never
  installed). The manager card renders a Start daemon affordance in Stopped, and
  the state survives across launcher restarts.
- **Universal Start / Stop buttons.** Work in both autostart and manual modes.
  Available from Running (Stop), Stopped (Start), and Installed (Stop, for the
  rare crashlooping case).
- **Live daemon log panel** in the manager card. `src/app/log_tailer.rs` polls
  `<data>/logs/daemon.stderr.log` every ~1.5s and emits `daemon-log-line`
  events. Frontend renders most recent ~300 lines with INFO/WARN/ERROR
  coloring + auto-scroll + Clear button. `recent_daemon_log_lines` command
  populates the panel on manager init.
- **First-run welcome wizard** (`frontend/js/first-run.js`). Three-field form
  (entity name / user name / timezone with IANA dropdown), then the bootstrap
  card with live progress ticker (git clone → stage Deno → warm cache).
- **Loud action-feedback UX.** Card-level action-progress banner with spinner +
  pulsing accent glow during any in-flight action. Button-level busy state with
  solid accent fill + trailing spinner + label swap ("Stop daemon" →
  "Stopping…"). Mis-click protection: while one button is busy, all sibling
  buttons in the same card are disabled.
- **In-app confirm modal** replacing `window.confirm` (which Tauri 2 blocks
  silently). Themed to match the launcher, default-focused on Cancel for
  destructive actions, Esc dismisses. Wired to Uninstall.
- **Gatekeeper documentation** in `README.md` — right-click → Open + `xattr`
  one-liner. v2 ships unsigned by deliberate decision.

### Changed

- **Wizard inputs no longer cached in `LauncherConfig`.** Dropped `entity_name`,
  `user_name`, `timezone` from the launcher config — they live exclusively in
  psycheros's `general-settings.json` now. Caching them on the launcher side
  caused drift the moment the user edited their entity name via psycheros's
  settings UI: the launcher's stale copy would re-stamp the file on next
  install. Single source of truth, owned by psycheros. Upgrade is automatic —
  serde ignores the legacy fields and they drop out of `config.json` on next
  save.
- **Migration story rewritten** to use Psycheros's native
  `/api/admin/entity-data/{export,import}` round-trip rather than a
  launcher-specific copy script. Removes parallel migration code and inherits
  the daemon-side fixes (post-import MCP restart, vault scope, etc.) for free.
  See `docs/migration.md`.
- **Docs refreshed** for the git-clone source model: `docs/bundle.md` renamed to
  `docs/source-provisioning.md` and rewritten; `docs/architecture.md` +
  `docs/release.md` tarball-era language swept; `docs/migration.md` rewritten.
- **`bundled_source_version`** now stores the tag name (e.g. `psycheros-v0.3.3`)
  rather than a SHA. Easier to read in config + UI.
- **Confirm dialog default-focus** on Cancel (was none) — Enter on accident
  doesn't fire destructive actions.
- **Snapshot rollback is atomic** via a rename swap in
  `restore_directory_atomically` (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`). The previous
  flow removed `<data>/.psycheros/` first and then copied the snapshot in — a
  mid-copy failure left a half-restored directory. New flow copies the snapshot
  to a sibling `.psycheros.tmp/`, renames the live dir aside to
  `.psycheros.old/`, promotes the temp dir into place, then deletes the backup.
  If promotion fails, the backup is renamed back. Two tests cover the happy path
  and the absent-snapshot branch.

### Removed

- **Embedded `release-bundle.tar.gz`** and the `bundle.resources` entry in
  `tauri.conf.json`. The `.app` no longer ships a source tarball.
- **`scripts/bundle-source.sh`** — produced the now-unused tarball. Deleted.
- **`scripts/migrate-from-v1.sh`** — replaced by Psycheros's native export/
  import flow.
- **`autostart_installed` field** from `LauncherConfig` — dead field, never read
  after install. Subsumed by `daemon_mode` semantics + on-disk probe.
- **`flate2` + `tar` Cargo deps** — no longer needed without the tarball.

### Fixed

- **MCP path-shattering bug** in `packages/psycheros/src/main.ts:119-121` —
  `mcpArgsStr.split(" ")` shattered paths containing spaces (broke the
  launcher's macOS install path `~/Library/Application Support/...`). Fix: build
  argv as a proper array. Shipped in `psycheros-v0.3.3`. See staging commit
  `2b84cbf`.
- **Post-update UI race** — `daemon_status` called immediately after
  `supervisor.restart()` could capture a transient `Installed` state before the
  daemon rebound the port. Manager now polls daemon_status for up to 30s after
  applying an update, rendering each intermediate state.
- **Tauri-2 sidecar resolution** — `resolve_sidecar_deno` tries four candidate
  paths (`deno`, `deno-<triple>`, `binaries/deno`, `binaries/deno-<triple>`)
  since Tauri's runtime layout for `externalBin` differs between dev and prod.
- **`git reset --hard origin/<branch>`** for tag fetches — switched to
  `FETCH_HEAD` which works for both branches and tags. Annotated tags peel to
  their commit automatically.
- **`--progress` on `git reset`** — emitted from `clone_or_fetch_source`'s reset
  step, where `--progress` is rejected as a usage error (exit 129). Removed from
  the reset args; kept on clone/fetch where it's accepted.
- **Migration pipe deadlock** in `run_migration_if_present`
  (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`). Previous code drained the child `deno`'s stderr
  to EOF and _then_ stdout to EOF — if stdout's ~64 KB pipe buffer filled while
  we were still reading stderr, the child blocked writing and the migration
  hung. Rewrote as two reader threads feeding an mpsc channel, so both streams
  drain concurrently and lines interleave in arrival order.

### Known gaps (not yet implemented)

- Linux + Windows supervisors return `NotImplemented`. Trait + stubs +
  module-doc implementation notes are in place; cross-platform work resumes when
  development moves to those machines.
- Auto-update for the Tauri shell binary via `tauri-plugin-updater`: not
  initialized. The plugin can't run without a real Ed25519 signing key, a
  manifest endpoint, and a CI signing step — all three need to land together
  (faked any one of them and the plugin either crashes at startup or is
  functionally inert). The four-step maintainer checklist is in `src/lib.rs`
  next to where the `.plugin()` call belongs. Source-side updates ship via the
  tag-tracking flow and don't depend on this; only the launcher's own `.app`
  shell binary still needs manual re-download on new releases until the keypair
  work happens.
- Real icon set (§5.24): blocked on a 1024² source PNG. The launcher currently
  ships placeholder violet squares. Once the design asset is provided, generate
  via `cargo tauri icon <path>` from `packages/launcher-v2/`; the script
  overwrites `src-tauri/icons/`.
- Code signing / notarization: none, by decision. Gatekeeper / SmartScreen
  workaround documented in README + `docs/release.md`.
