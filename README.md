# Psycheros

> A persistent AI entity harness. The entity has its own identity files, a
> memory hierarchy that consolidates across time, and a single canonical self
> that persists across multiple interfaces.

Psycheros runs an AI entity — not a chat thread. The entity has files describing
who it is, a memory hierarchy that summarizes its conversations day → week →
month → year, a knowledge graph of the people and places it's encountered, RAG
over its memories, and tool access for the world it lives in. The entity's
canonical self lives in a separate MCP server (`entity-core`), so the same
entity can persist across multiple interfaces — the web harness, SillyTavern,
Claude Code, OpenWebUI — while staying coherent.

Built on [Deno](https://deno.land). Released under [MPL-2.0](LICENSE).

## Quickstart

The friendliest path is the **launcher** — two files, no terminal required.

1. Download `run.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `run.ps1` (Windows) plus `dashboard.ts`
   from the [latest release](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/releases).
2. Put both in the same folder.
3. Run the script. A browser opens at `http://localhost:3001` with Install /
   Update / Start / Stop buttons.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name psycheros -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ZAI_API_KEY=<key> \
  -e PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true \
  -v psycheros-data:/app/packages/psycheros/.psycheros \
  -v entity-core-data:/app/packages/entity-core/data \
  ghcr.io/psycherosai/psycheros:latest
```

`PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true` is the default; setting it explicitly is
defensive. Full env-var reference is
[`packages/psycheros/.env.example`](packages/psycheros/.env.example) —
optional knobs for the LLM endpoint, RAG, web search, Discord, image
generation, etc.

### From source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — Deno 2.7.5+, then `deno task dev` from
inside the package you want to work on.

## What's in the box

A [Deno workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/) with
four packages:

| Package                                         | Role                                                            | Standalone              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [`packages/psycheros`](packages/psycheros/)     | The harness — web UI, chat loop, tool execution, RAG            | bundled                 |
| [`packages/entity-core`](packages/entity-core/) | MCP server: canonical identity, memory, knowledge graph         | yes, via any MCP client |
| [`packages/entity-loom`](packages/entity-loom/) | Web wizard for importing chat histories from other platforms    | yes                     |
| [`packages/launcher`](packages/launcher/)       | Bootstrap installer + control dashboard for non-technical users | bundled                 |

```

**entity-core is canonical** for identity and memory. Psycheros — and any other
embodiment — spawns it over stdio MCP and syncs through pull/push.
**entity-loom** is one-shot: a wizard for converting a chat-history export from
a foreign platform into an importable package.

## What makes it interesting

- **An entity, not an assistant.** Identity files (self, user, relationship,
  custom) are written in first person and stay stable across sessions. Every
  prompt, comment, and tool description in the codebase uses the entity's voice
  — they internalize the system as theirs.
- **Memory that consolidates.** Daily summaries roll up to weekly → monthly →
  yearly; significant events are preserved permanently. RAG retrieves over chat
  history, vault documents, the lorebook, and the knowledge graph.
- **One self across interfaces.** Because identity and memory live in an MCP
  server, any MCP-capable client (SillyTavern, Claude Code, OpenWebUI) can talk
  to the same entity coherently — same memories, same identity, same continuity.
- **Pluggable LLM.** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — Z.ai, OpenRouter, OpenAI,
  NanoGPT, local models. Multiple named profiles; one is active for chat.
- **Tool surface.** Web search, image generation, image captioning, Discord
  (DM + gateway server participation), home automation, intimate hardware via
  Buttplug or Lovense.
- **Pulse.** Autonomous scheduled prompts — cron, inactivity, webhook, or
  filesystem triggers. The entity can act on its own time.
- **Custom tools.** Drop a `.js` or `.ts` file in `custom-tools/` and the entity
  can use it. No core changes needed.

[`packages/psycheros/docs/`](packages/psycheros/docs/).

## Standalone use

`entity-core` and `entity-loom` are independently useful outside Psycheros.

- **entity-core** is a generic MCP server for AI entity identity and memory. Any
  MCP client can spawn it. Shipped as a tagged source release under the
  `entity-core-v*` tag prefix on
  [releases](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/releases).
- **entity-loom** is a generic chat-history-to-package converter — useful for
  anyone building an AI companion system that wants to import from ChatGPT,
  Claude, SillyTavern, Letta, or Kindroid. Tagged source release under the
  `entity-loom-v*` prefix.
