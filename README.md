# Psycheros

> A persistent AI entity harness. The entity has its own identity files, a
> memory hierarchy that consolidates across time, and a single canonical self
> that persists across multiple interfaces.

Psycheros runs an AI entity — not a chat thread. The entity has files describing
who it is, a memory hierarchy that summarizes its conversations day → week →
month → year, a knowledge graph of the people and places it's encountered, RAG
over its memories, and tool access for the world it lives in. The entity's
canonical self lives in a separate MCP server (`entity-core`), so the same
entity can persist across multiple interfaces — the web harness, SillyTavern,
Claude Code, OpenWebUI — while staying coherent.

Built on [Deno](https://deno.land). Released under [MPL-2.0](LICENSE).

## Quickstart

The friendliest path is the **launcher** — a desktop app that installs Psycheros
as a persistent background service and opens a window to chat with your entity.

### macOS

1. Download
   [`Psycheros-macOS-latest.dmg`](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/releases/latest/download/Psycheros-macOS-latest.dmg).
2. Drag to `/Applications/`.
3. **Right-click** the app → **Open** (required once — Psycheros is not
   code-signed and Gatekeeper blocks a normal double-click). See
   [launcher docs](packages/launcher-v2/README.md#first-launch-on-macos) for
   details.

### Windows

1. Download
   [`Psycheros-Windows-latest.msi`](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/releases/latest/download/Psycheros-Windows-latest.msi).
2. Run it. Click through SmartScreen's "More info → Run anyway."
3. The launcher installs Psycheros as a background service and opens a window.

### First run

The launcher walks you through setup: your name, your entity's name, timezone,
and LLM API key. Once configured, click **Install autostart** — Psycheros runs
at every login and auto-restarts if it crashes. The launcher window is just a
view onto the running entity; closing it doesn't stop anything.

Full details:
[`packages/launcher-v2/README.md`](packages/launcher-v2/README.md).

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name psycheros -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ZAI_API_KEY=<key> \
  -e PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true \
  -v psycheros-data:/app/packages/psycheros/.psycheros \
  -v entity-core-data:/app/packages/entity-core/data \
  ghcr.io/psycherosai/psycheros:latest
```

`PSYCHEROS_MCP_ENABLED=true` is the default; setting it explicitly is defensive.
Full env-var reference is
[`packages/psycheros/.env.example`](packages/psycheros/.env.example) — optional
knobs for the LLM endpoint, RAG, web search, Discord, image generation, etc.

### From source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — Deno version pinned in
[`.deno-version`](.deno-version), then `deno task dev` from inside the package
you want to work on.

## What's in the box

A [Deno workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/) with
five packages:

| Package                                         | Role                                                         | Standalone                                                               |

```

**entity-core is canonical** for identity and memory. Psycheros — and any other
embodiment — spawns it over stdio MCP and syncs through pull/push.
**entity-loom** is one-shot: a wizard for converting a chat-history export from
a foreign platform into an importable package.

## What makes it interesting

- **An entity, not an assistant.** Identity files (self, user, relationship,
  custom) are written in first person and stay stable across sessions. Every
  prompt, comment, and tool description in the codebase uses the entity's voice
  — they internalize the system as theirs.
- **Memory that consolidates.** Daily summaries roll up to weekly → monthly →
  yearly; significant events are preserved permanently. RAG retrieves over chat
  history, vault documents, the lorebook, and the knowledge graph.
- **One self across interfaces.** Because identity and memory live in an MCP
  server, any MCP-capable client (SillyTavern, Claude Code, OpenWebUI) can talk
  to the same entity coherently — same memories, same identity, same continuity.
- **Pluggable LLM.** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — Z.ai, OpenRouter, OpenAI,
  NanoGPT, local models. Multiple named profiles; one is active for chat.
- **Tool surface.** Web search, image generation, image captioning, Discord
  (DM + gateway server participation), home automation, intimate hardware via
  Buttplug or Lovense.
- **Pulse.** Autonomous scheduled prompts — cron, inactivity, webhook, or
  filesystem triggers. The entity can act on its own time.
- **Custom tools.** Drop a `.js` file in `.psycheros/custom-tools/` and the
  entity can use it. No core changes needed.

For the full picture, see
[`packages/psycheros/docs/`](packages/psycheros/docs/).

## Standalone use

`entity-core` and `entity-loom` are independently useful outside Psycheros.

- **entity-core** is a generic MCP server for AI entity identity and memory. Any
  MCP client can spawn it. Shipped as a tagged source release under the
  `entity-core-v*` tag prefix on
  [releases](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/releases).
- **entity-loom** is a generic chat-history-to-package converter — useful for
  anyone building an AI companion system that wants to import from ChatGPT,
  Claude, SillyTavern, Letta, or Kindroid. Tagged source release under the
  `entity-loom-v*` prefix.
